# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

I am proud that I figured out how to do all of the exercises! I was pretty nervous about starting the workload today after yesterday's `for` statements. I was anticipating a lot more unproductive stuggle than what I had, though I am still behind where I hoped I would be by this time. 

- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?

Functions in js are similar to functions in math. We can set up a set of rules (the function itself). Based on those rules, we can give an input and recieve an output. This allows for efficient calculations and outputs.
